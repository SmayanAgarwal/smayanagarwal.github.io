I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Ashoka University. My research interest lies in theoretical CS, focusing on automata and logic. I am currently working with [Professor Aalok Thakkar](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/aalok-thakkar/) on understanding probability distributions over strings through the lens of finite state machines. 

Previously I have worked under [Professor Urbasi Sinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbasi_Sinha) on applying quantum computing algorithms to 1-D and 2-D data.

I am actively looking for opportunities for the summer of 2025.


**Research Interests:**
- Automata Theory, Logic, Algebra
- Cryptography
- Algorithms
