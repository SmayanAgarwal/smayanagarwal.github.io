I am a third-year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Mathematics at Ashoka University. My research interest lies in theoretical CS, focusing on automata and logic. In the past I have interned with Professor Urbasi Sinha at Raman Research Institute and focused on Quantum Computing. I was born and brought up in Calcutta, and now live in Darjeeling.
