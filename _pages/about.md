I am a third-year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Mathematics at Ashoka University. My research interest lies in theoretical CS, focusing on automata and logic. I am currently working with [Professor Aalok Thakkar](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/aalok-thakkar/) on a paper about weighted automata. 

I am actively looking for opportunities for the summer of 2025.


**Research Interests:**
- Theoretical Computer Science (Automata, Complexity Theory)
- Quantum Computing
- Machine Learning Verification
